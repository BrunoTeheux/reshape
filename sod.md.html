**ReShape: a Collaborative Art Experience**
                *Hugo Parlier and Bruno Teheux* 

# Introduction

The genesis of this project emerged from observing the remarkable balance achieved by abstract artists in their compositions using minimal geometric elements (including Aurélie Némours, Theo van Doesburg, Vilmos Huszár, Vassily Kandinsky, and Piet Mondrian). Their works demonstrate how fundamental graphic components—squares, circles, and points—combined with restricted color palettes can create compelling artistic expressions.

Intrigued by the universal appeal of these works, we designed a crowdsourcing art initiative to explore this phenomenon collaboratively. Over a twelve-month period, visitors to our partner institutions participated in creating geometric compositions through an interactive tablet interface. The creative process was structured by offering participants a curated selection of elements: curves, geometric shapes, and pixel-based designs.

The collected visitors' contributions underwent various aggregation processes, forming the foundation for a unique interdisciplinary collaboration. Three composers transformed these visual data into distinct musical compositions through sonification techniques. Working closely with these composers, we developed corresponding visualizations for the final performance at the *Sound of Data Project*—a collaborative venture between the University of Luxembourg, the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR), the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), and Rockhal, presented as part of Esch2022 European Capital of Culture.

This report documents the project's conceptual framework, implementation process, collaborative dynamics, and outcomes, while also identifying potential areas for future investigation.

# Data Collection Methodololy

The data collection phase was conceived as an outreach activity, designed to engage the public with mathematical principles through artistic expression. To facilitate this engagement, we collaborated with a commissioned designer to create an aesthetically appealing iPad stand, enabling data collection across multiple locations.

A bespoke application was commissioned, featuring a minimalist interface that encouraged intuitive interaction while maintaining robust backend capabilities for data storage and retrieval. The simplicity of the interface was designed to ensure an engaging user experience.

Data collection sites were strategically selected to reach diverse audiences, including the University of Luxembourg, Centre Culturel Opderschmelz, Rotondes, Neimënster Abbey, various local high schools, and the Luxembourg Learning Centre. 

The project's reach extended beyond midterm installations in local venues to significant cultural events, including the Science Meets Music event and Researchers Days. Most notably, we conducted a ten-day [data collection and mediation session](https://math.uni.lu/outreach/recreate/) at the Luxembourg Pavillon of the World Expo Dubai 2020, significantly expanding the project's international scope.

Throughout the data collection process, we prioritized mediated interactions, providing guidance and explanation to participants. This approach created natural opportunities for informal discussions between researchers and participants about the mathematical principles underlying the artistic creation process and the various possible aggregation techniques.

By November 2022, the project had amassed a substantial dataset of approximately 20,000 participant-generated drawings, which formed the foundation for the subsequent sonification phase.

# Data set

The data collection interface offered participants three distinct drawing modalities:

 1. *Curve-Based Compositions*. Participants created drawings by generating curves that traversed the iPad screen from left to right. The regions formed by these curves were automatically colored based on two parameters: the mathematical winding number of the curves and the participant's color selection from a predefined palette. The constraint of left-to-right traversal ensured consistency in the data structure while allowing for significant creative variation.
 2. *Shape Compositions.* This modality invited participants to construct abstract compositions using combinations of three basic geometric shapes: circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals. Participants could freely draw these shapes, and the regions formed by their intersections were colored according to [XXX]. This approach allowed for exploration of compositional balance through fundamental geometric elements.
 3. *Grid-Based Pixel Art.* The third modality consisted of fixed-size grid structures where participants created pixel art compositions. This format provided a discrete approach to geometric composition, contrasting with the continuous nature of the other two modalities.

Across all three drawing types, participants worked with a curated and limited color palette. This constraint not only ensured consistency across the collected dataset but also aligned with the minimalist principles observed in the geometric abstract art that inspired the project.

# Aggregation
The transformation of our collected drawings into collective visual expressions formed a crucial bridge between public participation and artistic creation of the music composers of the project. We explored various aggregation methods not as analytical tools, but as means to create new content that would capture the collective creative expression of all participants.

**Curve-based drawings.** For the curve-based drawings, we developed two complementary approaches. The first method synthesized an 'average curve' by using the mathematical structure of the connected Bézier curves, creating a visual representation that embodied the drawing trajectories of thousands of participants.

Our second approach explored the space between curves by implementing the Fréchet distance as a measure, allowing us to visualize shortest paths between different drawings. Despite the computational complexity, we succeeded in approximating this metric space, revealing fascinating visual journeys through the space of all collected curves.

**Shape-based drawings.** The shape-based compositions were aggregated through a process that computed average forms for each geometric shape. This process transformed the individual circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals into collective shapes that carried traces of all participant contributions, creating new geometric forms at the barycentre of all these contributions.

**Pixel art.** For the pixel art compositions, we chose to preserve the discrete nature of the drawing experience through dynamic visualization. By generating a time-lapse of heat maps of the public action on the pixels, we created a flowing visual narrative that revealed how thousands of participants collectively activated the pixel grid over time. This approach produced an evolving artwork that celebrated the cumulative creative process.

# Musical Interpretation, Sonification and vizualization

The visual data collected through public participation served as the foundation for three distinct musical compositions. In this phase of the project, we adopted a deliberately open approach, entrusting the composers with complete artistic freedom in their interpretation of the geometric datasets. Each composer developed their own unique vision for translating the visual elements into musical compositions.

We worked closely with each composer to identify which aspects of the geometric data resonated most strongly with their artistic vision, and then developed the appropriate data extraction methods to support their creative process. 

In parallel with this music composition process, we developed corresponding visual representations to accompany each composition. These visualizations were designed to maintain coherence between the original geometric data, its musical interpretation, and its final visual presentation, creating a complete audiovisual experience that honored both the mathematical foundation of the project and the composers' artistic interpretations.

## Mean curve and collective pixel beat 

[Hester-1](https://www.hester-1.com/)'s composition ["Mean curve and collective pixel beat"](https://www.hester-1.com/music-sound) integrates both geometric and temporal aspects of the collected data. The composition unfolds in two distinct movements, each exploring different dimensions of the collective creative process.

**First Movement: Polyphonic Curves and Human Generated Chaos.**
The first movement translates the mathematical properties of the mean curve—its spatial coordinates and tangent data—into a polyphonic arrangement for bowed strings. This foundational layer is enriched by incorporating sonified data from ten randomly selected individual curve drawings, creating a dialogue between the collective average and individual expressions. The accompanying visualization presents an exploration centered on the mean curve phenomenon. Through a carefully crafted zoom into the averaged curve of all participants' drawings, the visualization reveals two concurrent mathematical realities: the emergent collective behavior manifested in the global average pattern, and the intricate local chaos generated by the mathematical averaging process. 

**Second Movement: Pixel Rhythms and Collective Heat Map.**
The second movement transitions to a rhythmic structure derived from the temporal data of pixel drawing interactions. Each screen tap from the original pixel drawing sessions is transformed into a distinct sound, combining computer-generated tones and violin pizzicato to create what the composer terms a "collective beat." This part of the composition is visually represented through an evolving heat map animation that captures the temporal and spatial distribution of participants' interactions, highlighting areas of concentrated activity.

## Sounding Shadows ReShaped

[Mike von der Nahmer's](http://www.petermichaelvondernahmer.com/) "Sounding Shadows ReShaped" offers a humanistic interpretation of the curve dataset, prioritizing narrative and emotional resonance over purely algorithmic sonification. The composition unfolds in three distinct movements, each exploring different aspects of human expression through the collected curves.

**First Movement: The Human Heartbeat.**
The first movement draws inspiration from curves reminiscent of cardiac rhythms, translating these natural patterns into a musical heartbeat accompanied by morphing curve visualizations. This biological metaphor creates an immediate connection between the mathematical forms and human experience.

**Second Movement: The Feedback Loop.**
The second movement emerged through an innovative feedback loop: participants created new curves while listening to von der Nahmer's previous compositions, which were then visualized as fading trace animations. These emotionally-informed drawings served as the basis for a musical re-interpretation, effectively giving voice to the participants' visual responses to his original works. This recursive process created a unique dialogue between composer and the participants, and the visualization of their interactions.

**Third Movement: Mathematical Tribute.**
The final movement pays tribute to selected representative drawings from the dataset, accompanied by visualizations that gradually reveal the mathematical complexity of the coloring process, culminating in an animation of a selected shortest path in the space of curves. This movement represents a synthesis of the project's mathematical and artistic elements.

Throughout the piece, von der Nahmer acknowledges the project's international scope and human-centered approach,informally paying tribute to the diverse collection sites including the World Expo Dubai 2020. The composition reflects both the mathematical structure and the global, collaborative spirit of the project, creating a musical narrative that cross cultural boundaries.

## Pixelised Harmony


Timelord's "Pixelised Harmony" is structured around a continuous ambient foundation overlaid with a metamorphic main composition that evolves from chaos to order.

The foundational layer consists of a soundscape derived from the pixel art dataset. Using the six-by-six grid drawings as source material, each pixel interaction was assigned a unique sonic representation. These individual sound elements were then layered to create an ambient texture that runs throughout the piece, providing a sonic backdrop for the main compositional elements.

The primary voice of the composition, derived from the shape-based drawings, unfolds in two distinct phases:

**Chaos Unveiled.** The first phase sonifies 120 individual shape-based drawings, with each geometric form (circle, triangle, and quadrilateral) assigned a distinct sound signature. The resulting composition manifests as controlled chaos, directly reflecting the diverse and unpredictable nature of individual contributions.

**Emergence of Order.** The second phase implements a moving average algorithm to gradually reveal order within the apparent chaos. Beginning with pairs of drawings, the averaging process progressively incorporates more compositions, sonically representing this convergence through a gradual transformation of disparate notes into a coherent central harmony. This musical evolution mirrors the visual averaging process, where individual geometric compositions merge into collective forms, culminating in the general averages of all the collected shapes. 

The visual design parallels the sonic architecture through three integrated layers that work in concert to create a mesmerizing experience. Like a living canvas, a dynamic backdrop animates the pixel art drawings that form the foundational soundscape, creating a constantly evolving visual texture that pulses and shifts with the ambient sound base. 

In the foreground, during the chaotic first movement, three distinct families of shapes perform their own choreographed sequence. Like the diverse crowd on a dance floor, each geometric family contributes to the collective energy of the resulting ballet.

As the piece transitions into its second phase, these three parallel dances give way to a hypnotic visualization of the averaging algorithm at work. Within each geometric family, the shapes begin to converge, their individual characteristics gradually dissolving to the average ones. 

Through this dynamic interpretation, "Pixelised Harmony" demonstrates how elementary mathematical concepts—primarily averaging and convergence—can lead to structural harmony from apparent disorder. This fusion of mathematical objects and concepts with contemporary electronic music illustrates how mathematical principles can transcend their abstract nature to create tribal, engaging experiences that resonate with diverse audiences, and pay a primal and visceral tribute to the universality of mathematics.
