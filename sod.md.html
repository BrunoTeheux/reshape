# Introduction

The genesis of this project emerged from observing the remarkable balance achieved by abstract
artists in their compositions using minimal geometric elements (including Aurélie Némours, Theo van
Doesburg, Vilmos Huszár, Vassily Kandinsky, and Piet Mondrian). Their works demonstrate how
fundamental graphic components—squares, circles, and points—combined with restricted color palettes
can create compelling artistic expressions.

Intrigued by the intrinsic harmony of these works, we designed a crowdsourcing art initiative to
explore this phenomenon collaboratively. Over a twelve-month period at various collection points,
visitors created geometric compositions through an interactive tablet interface. The creative
process was structured by offering participants a curated selection of elements: curves, geometric
shapes, and pixel-based designs.

The collected contributions underwent various aggregation processes, forming the foundation for a
unique interdisciplinary collaboration. Three composers transformed these visual data sets into
distinct musical compositions through various sonification techniques. Working closely with these
composers, we developed corresponding visualizations for the final performance at the [*Sound of
Data
Project*](https://www.fnr.lu/research-with-impact-fnr-highlight/flashback-sound-of-data-where-science-meets-music/)—a
collaborative venture between the [University of Luxembourg](http://www.uni.lu), the [Luxembourg
National Research Fund](http://www.fnr.lu) (FNR), the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and
Technology](http://www.list.lu) (LIST), and [Rocklab](https://rocklab.lu), presented as part of
[Esch2022 European Capital of Culture](https://esch2022.lu/fr/).

This report documents the project's conceptual framework, implementation process, collaborative
dynamics, and outcomes, while also identifying potential areas for future investigation.

# Data Collection Methodololy

The data collection phase was conceived as an outreach activity, designed to engage the public with
mathematical principles through artistic expression. To facilitate this engagement, we collaborated
with a commissioned designer to create an aesthetically appealing tablet stand, enabling data
collection across multiple locations.  ![Tablet Stand for Data Collection](img/stand.jpg
width="300px")

A bespoke application was commissioned, featuring a minimalist interface that encouraged intuitive
interaction while maintaining robust backend functionalities for data storage and retrieval. The
simplicity of the interface was designed to ensure an engaging user experience.

Data collection sites were strategically selected to reach diverse audiences. These included the
[University of Luxembourg](http://www.uni.lu), [Centre Culturel
Opderschmelz](https://opderschmelz.lu/), [Rotondes](https://www.rotondes.lu/), [Neimënster
Abbey](https://www.neimenster.lu/), the [Luxembourg Science
Center](https://www.science-center.lu/fr), various local high schools, and the [Luxembourg Learning
Centre](https://www.uni.lu/llc-en/). 

The project's reach extended beyond installations in local venues to significant cultural
events, including the [Science Meets Music event](https://youtu.be/t8oUIwb9A4A?si=DDpSA95OTjLqYuuw)
and the [Researchers Days 2022](https://youtu.be/SPnI2f89fW8?si=Kt-MASVWTlMWH3GI). Most notably, we
conducted a ten-day [data collection and mediation session](https://math.uni.lu/outreach/recreate/)
at the [Luxembourg Pavillon of the World Expo in Dubai in 2022](https://math.uni.lu/outreach/recreate/),
significantly expanding the project's international scope.

Throughout the data collection process, we prioritized mediated interactions, providing guidance and
explanation to participants. This approach created natural opportunities for informal discussions
between researchers and participants about the mathematical principles underlying the artistic
creation process and the various possible aggregation techniques.

By November 2022, the project had amassed a substantial dataset of approximately 20,000
participant-generated drawings, which formed the foundation for the subsequent sonification phase.

# Data set

The data collection interface offered participants three distinct drawing modalities:

 1. *Curve-Based Compositions*. Participants created drawings by generating curves that traversed
 the iPad screen from left to right. The regions formed by these curves were automatically colored
 based on two parameters: the mathematical winding number of the curves and the participant's color
 selection from a predefined palette. The constraint of left-to-right traversality ensured consistency
 in the data structure while allowing for significant creative variation.  2. *Shape Compositions.*
 This modality invited participants to construct abstract compositions using combinations of three
 basic geometric shapes: circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals. Participants could freely draw
 these shapes, and the regions formed by their intersections were colored according to a
 mathematical principle. This approach allowed for exploration of compositional balance through
 fundamental geometric elements.  3. *Grid-Based Pixel Art.* The third modality consisted of
 fixed-size grid structures where participants created pixel art compositions. This format provided
 a discrete approach to geometric composition, contrasting with the continuous nature of the other
 two modalities.

Across all three drawing types, participants worked with a curated and limited color palette. This
constraint not only ensured consistency across the collected datasets but was also inline with the
minimalist principles observed in the geometric abstract art that inspired the project.

# Aggregation

The transformation of our collected drawings into collective visual expressions formed a crucial
bridge between public participation and the artistic creation of the music by composers.
We explored various aggregation methods, not as analytical tools, but as means to create new
content that would capture the collective creative expression of all participants.

**Curve-based drawings.** For the curve-based drawings, we developed two complementary approaches.
The first method synthesized an 'average curve' by using the mathematical structure of the connected
Bézier curves, creating a visual representation that embodied the drawing trajectories of thousands
of participants. 

![Average curve](img/MeanBW.svg width="600px") ![Animated zoom on an inner portion of the average
curve](img/AverageCurve.webm)

Our second approach explored the space between curves by implementing the so-called Fréchet distance as a
measure, allowing us to visualize shortest paths between different drawings. Despite the
computational complexity, we succeeded in approximating this metric space, revealing fascinating
visual journeys through the space of all collected curves.

![Animation of a shortest path in the space of curves](img/Geodesic.webm)

**Shape-based drawings.** The shape-based compositions were aggregated through a process that
computed an average shape for eachi type of the proposed geometry shape. This process transformed
the individual circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals into collective shapes that carried traces of
all contributions, creating new geometric forms at ther barycenter.

![Average shapes](img/Mean_Shapes.svg width="600px")

**Pixel art.** For the pixel art compositions, we chose to preserve the discrete nature of the
drawing experience through dynamic visualization. By generating a time-lapse of heat maps of the
public action on the pixels, we created a flowing visual narrative that revealed how thousands of
participants collectively activated the pixel grid over time. This approach produced an evolving
artwork that celebrated the cumulative creative process.

# Musical Interpretation, Sonification and vizualization

The visual data collected through public participation served as the foundation for three distinct
musical compositions. In this phase of the project, we adopted a deliberately open approach,
entrusting the composers with complete artistic freedom in their interpretation of the geometric
datasets. Each composer developed their own unique vision for translating the visual elements into
musical compositions.

We worked closely with each composer to identify which aspects of the geometric data resonated most
strongly with their artistic vision, and then developed the appropriate data extraction methods to
support their creative process. 

In parallel to the musical composition process, we developed corresponding visual representations.
These visualizations were designed to maintain coherence between the original data, its
musical interpretation, and its final presentation, creating a complete audiovisual
experience that honored both the mathematical foundations of the project and the composers' artistic
interpretations.

## Mean curve and collective pixel beat 

[Hester-1](https://www.hester-1.com/)'s composition ["Mean curve and collective pixel
beat"](https://www.hester-1.com/music-sound) integrates both geometric and temporal aspects of the
collected data. The composition unfolds in two distinct movements, each exploring different
dimensions of the collective creative process.

**First Movement: Polyphonic Curves and Human Generated Chaos.** The first movement translates the
mathematical properties of the mean curve—its spatial coordinates and tangent data—into a polyphonic
arrangement for bowed strings. This foundational layer is enriched by incorporating sonified data
from ten randomly selected individual curve drawings, creating a dialogue between the collective
average and individual expressions. The accompanying visualization presents an exploration centered
on the mean curve phenomenon. Through a carefully crafted zoom into the averaged curve of all
participants' drawings, the visualization reveals two concurrent mathematical realities: the
emergent collective behavior manifested in the global average pattern, and the intricate local chaos
generated by the mathematical averaging process. 

**Second Movement: Pixel Rhythms and Collective Heat Map.** The second movement transitions to a
rhythmic structure derived from the temporal data of pixel drawing interactions. Each screen tap
from the original pixel drawing sessions is transformed into a distinct sound, combining
computer-generated tones and violin pizzicato to create what the composer terms a "collective beat."
This part of the composition is visually represented through an evolving heat map animation that
captures the temporal and spatial distribution of participants' interactions, highlighting areas of
concentrated activity.

beat"](https://youtu.be/KgzM6lkjmJc?si=yEw8y8UlMkhMk0tX)

## Sounding Shadows ReShaped

[Mike von der Nahmer's](http://www.petermichaelvondernahmer.com/) "Sounding Shadows ReShaped" offers
a humanistic interpretation of the curve dataset, prioritizing narrative and emotional resonance
over purely algorithmic sonification. The composition unfolds in three distinct movements, each
exploring different aspects of human expression through the collected curves.

**First Movement: The Human Heartbeat.** The first movement draws inspiration from curves
reminiscent of cardiac rhythms, translating these natural patterns into a musical heartbeat
accompanied by morphing curve visualizations. This biological metaphor creates an immediate
connection between the mathematical forms and the human experience.

**Second Movement: The Feedback Loop.** The second movement emerged through an innovative feedback
loop: participants created new curves while listening to von der Nahmer's previous compositions,
which were then visualized as fading trace animations. These emotionally-informed drawings served as
the basis for a musical re-interpretation, effectively giving voice to the participants' visual
responses to his original work. This recursive process created a unique dialogue between composer
and the participants, and the visualization of their interactions.

**Third Movement: Mathematical Tribute.** The final movement pays tribute to selected representative
drawings from the dataset, accompanied by visualizations that gradually reveal the mathematical
complexity of the coloring process, culminating in an animation of a selected shortest path in the
space of curves. This movement represents a synthesis of the project's mathematical and artistic
elements.

Throughout the piece, von der Nahmer acknowledges the project's international scope and
human-centered approach,informally paying tribute to the diverse collection sites including the
World Expo in Dubai. The composition reflects both the mathematical structure and the global,
collaborative spirit of the project, creating a musical narrative that cross cultural boundaries.

## Pixelised Harmony


[Timelord](https://www.timelord.lu/)'s "Pixelised Harmony" is structured around a continuous ambient
foundation overlaid with a metamorphic main composition that evolves from chaos to order.

The foundational layer consists of a soundscape derived from the pixel art dataset. Using the
six-by-six grid drawings as source material, each pixel interaction was assigned a unique sonic
representation. These individual sound elements were then layered to create an ambient texture that
runs throughout the piece, providing a sonic backdrop for the main compositional elements.

The primary voice of the composition, derived from the shape-based drawings, unfolds in two distinct
phases:

**Chaos Unveiled.** The first phase sonifies 120 individual shape-based drawings, with each
geometric form (circle, triangle, and quadrilateral) assigned a distinct sound signature. The
resulting composition manifests as controlled chaos, directly reflecting the diverse and
unpredictable nature of individual contributions.

**Emergence of Order.** The second phase implements a moving average algorithm to gradually reveal
order within the apparent chaos. Beginning with pairs of drawings, the averaging process
progressively incorporates more compositions, sonically representing this convergence through a
gradual transformation of disparate notes into a coherent central harmony. This musical evolution
mirrors the visual averaging process, where individual geometric compositions merge into collective
forms, culminating in the general averages of all the collected shapes. 

The visual design parallels the sonic architecture through three integrated layers that work in
concert to create a mesmerizing experience. Like a living canvas, a dynamic backdrop animates the
pixel art drawings that form the foundational soundscape, creating a constantly evolving visual
texture that pulses and shifts with the ambient sound base. 

In the foreground, during the chaotic first movement, three distinct families of shapes perform
their own choreographed sequence. Like the diverse crowd on a dance floor, each geometric family
contributes to the collective energy of the resulting ballet.

As the piece transitions into its second phase, these three parallel dances give way to a hypnotic
visualization of the averaging algorithm at work. Within each geometric family, the shapes begin to
converge, their individual characteristics gradually dissolving to the average ones. 

Through this dynamic interpretation, "Pixelised Harmony" demonstrates how elementary mathematical
concepts—primarily averaging and convergence—can lead to structural harmony from apparent disorder.
This fusion of mathematical objects and concepts with contemporary electronic music illustrates how
mathematical principles can transcend their abstract nature to create tribal, engaging experiences
that resonate with diverse audiences, and pay a primal and visceral tribute to the universality of
mathematics.

# Final Performance

The ReShape project's final presentation formed part of the [Sound of Data
Project](https://www.fnr.lu/research-with-impact-fnr-highlight/flashback-sound-of-data-where-science-meets-music/)
showcase on December 2, 2022, an event of [Esch2022 European Capital of
Culture](https://esch2022.lu/fr/). The showcase took place at [Rockhal](https://rockhal.lu/),
Luxembourg's premier concert venue in Esch-sur-Alzette, drawing an audience of over 500
attendees.The three compositions and their corresponding visualizations were integrated into a
program of [eleven
pieces](https://www.fnr.lu/research-with-impact-fnr-highlight/flashback-sound-of-data-where-science-meets-music/),
all exploring different approaches to data sonification and visualization. The program was
structured in two parts. The first segment presented all eleven Sound of Data pieces, including our
three ReShape works. This concatenation of different approaches to data sonification provided the
audience with a glimpse of how various types of data can be transformed into artistic experiences.
Our project's focus on geometric and mathematical transformations of public contributions offered a
distinct perspective within this diverse showcase.

The second half of the evening featured electronic musician and science trained [Max
Cooper](https://maxcooper.net/), whose selection as the headlining artist provided a fitting
contextual framework for the entire Sound of Data Project.

# Takeaways

The ReShape project revealed several key insights about public engagement with mathematics through
artistic expression. We identified multiple factors contributing to the project's success in
engaging diverse audiences.

**Synergistic Integration of Art and Mathematics.** The project's approach of combining mathematical
and artistic creativity proved particularly effective. While traditional outreach activities often
struggle to engage participants in either pure mathematical exercises or standalone artistic
contributions, our integrated approach successfully bridged this gap. By framing mathematical
concepts within a creative context, we observed significantly higher engagement levels than
typically seen in single-domain activities.

**Role of Interactive Feedback.** The immediate visual feedback provided through the algorithmic
coloring process served as a crucial engagement mechanism. Participants were not merely creating
static drawings but engaging with a dynamic system that responded to their input. This interactive
element encouraged experimentation with the mathematical constraints and motivated participants to
create multiple compositions. The process generated natural curiosity about the underlying
mechanisms while creating an engaging feedback loop between artistic intent and mathematical
transformation.

**Human-Centered Mediation.** The mediated nature of the data collection process proved essential to
the project's success. Rather than relying on automated or self-guided interactions, the presence of
facilitators maintained focus on the profound human component of mathematical activity. As for
mathematics or art, human interactions were an essential ingredient of the drawings collection
process.

**Reframing Mathematical Engagement.** The project demonstrated an alternative approach to
mathematical outreach. Instead of presenting mathematics primarily as a tool or "the language of
science"—requiring explanation and instruction—ReShape positioned mathematics as a creative medium.
This shift from explaining mathematics to experiencing it through creative expression resulted in
more natural and engaging interactions with mathematical concepts, and foster an update in the
audience's perspective on mathematics.

**Universal Accessibility.** The project's success in engaging diverse audiences across generations
and cultures highlighted the universal appeal of creative geometry based expression. The combination
of basic geometric elements, intuitive drawing interfaces, immediate visual feedback, and a
collaborative framework created an accessible entry point for mathematical engagement regardless of
participants' background or prior mathematical experience.

**Creative Parallels.** The project's collaborative nature effectively highlighted natural parallels
between artistic and mathematical creation. The interdependence of artistic works within broader
cultural contexts mirrored the interconnected nature of mathematical theorems. The creative process
in both domains emerged as inherently collaborative and cumulative, while the need for creativity in
art naturally extended to understanding mathematics as a creative process. 


# Perspectives

Our experience with the ReShape project has opened several promising avenues for future
investigation and development. The collected data and observations from the project implementation
suggest multiple directions for both research and outreach activities.

Initial observations indicate potential cultural signatures in the geometric compositions,
particularly when comparing drawings collected in Dubai with those from the Greater Region. While
this pattern is intriguing, it requires rigorous scientific investigation to validate and quantify
these apparent cultural influences on geometric expression. 

The interaction between music and geometric creation presents another fascinating research
direction. During sessions where participants created drawings while listening to Mike von der
Nahmer's compositions, we observed apparent correlations between specific musical pieces and drawing
characteristics. A systematic study of these relationships could reveal interesting connections
between auditory stimuli and geometric expression, potentially opening new pathways for
understanding cross-modal creative processes.

The project's framing as an artistic collaborative endeavor, rather than a mathematical exercise,
appeared to significantly impact public engagement. This observation suggests the need for a
longitudinal study examining how such framing affects both immediate participation and long-term
attitudes toward mathematics. Understanding these dynamics could inform future approaches to
mathematical outreach and education.

Our experience also suggests a promising pedagogical sequence: introducing mathematical concepts
through creative engagement before formal explanation. This approach, where meaning precedes
technical exposition, shows potential for deeper engagement with mathematical tools when they are
subsequently presented in dedicated workshops. This sequencing warrants further investigation as a
model for mathematical outreach.

The project has generated a substantial dataset of coherent, human-produced geometric drawings that
remains largely unexplored. This collection presents numerous opportunities for future research,
including investigations into classification methods, complexity measures, and proximity metrics.
Such analyses could provide insights into patterns of human geometric thinking and creativity.

Looking forward, we plan to refine the drawing activity by further simplifying its implementation.
This refinement aims to distill the experience to its essential creative and mathematical
components, potentially making it more accessible while maintaining its effectiveness as a bridge
between artistic and mathematical thinking.

These perspectives suggest that the ReShape project, beyond its immediate success as an outreach
initiative, has laid groundwork for multiple strands of future research and development in the
intersection of mathematics, art, and public engagement.
